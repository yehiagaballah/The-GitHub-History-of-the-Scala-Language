# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language

Hey There, 

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected of the output.

This code tests a dataset of the data produced for stocks prices across different kinds of analysis and offers a comparisson between Amazon and Facebook stocks to offer a recommendation for which stocks to buy

The analysis follows the origins of [The Scala Programming Language](https://www.scala-lang.org) on GitHub, who are the top users and the top projects that have been committed over the years and how it grew as a common programming language.
